Dbfit length = 13408
TimeAxis_DCS length = 13408
Unique TimeAxis_DCS length = 13408

Calculating sampling constants...

DCS sampling frequency is: 19.9999 hz. Or every 0.05 seconds
ABP sampling frequency is: 124.9984 hz. Or every 0.0080001 seconds


Temporally overlapping signals...

The ABP signal starts at 2217.6818 seconds and ends at 2888.0262 seconds for a total length of : 670.3444 seconds or 11.1724 minutes
The DCS signal starts at 2217.6779 seconds and ends at 2888.0312 seconds for a total length of : 670.3533 seconds or 11.1726 minutes
The DCS signal starts first by 0.0039455


Downsampling to a constant frequency...

Downsampling time interval is from 1 to 13408 in 0.05 second intervals.
Downsample ABP signal at a rate of approximately 6 hz for a sampling rate of 19.9999 hz 
Downsampling time interval is from 1 to 13408 in 0.05 second intervals.
Both signals now sampled from t = 2217.6779 to 2888.0312
